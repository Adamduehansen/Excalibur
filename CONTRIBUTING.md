## Requirements

You will need have the TypeScript compiler installed on your platform to build from source.

The compiler is available here:

**Note: Excalibur only supports the newest TypeScript 9.x compiler**

### To build the engine and run the sample game on these platforms:

Using Node.js:

	npm install
  
This will install any dev dependencies in your directory.

Windows:
